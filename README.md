# Reinforcement-Learning-Project - Space Invader

## Project Goal
To examine the effect of different game representations on different models

## Space  Invader Representation
 - Each state represent by the screenshot as we explain in the preprocess
 - Each state represent ram representation - each state composed from 128 bytes that describe the game, this yield vector (1,128)

## Models:
 - Deep Q-learning - Main & Target
 - REINFORCE(MC)
 - Actor Critic
